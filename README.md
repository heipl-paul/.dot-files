Sharing dot-files across my UNIX devices

# How to use

simply add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
source ~/[path-to-repo]/zsh/.alias
source ~/[path-to-repo]/zsh/.prompt
source ~/[path-to-repo]/zsh/.zsh-git-info
```

Asssuming you cloned the repo directly in your home directory, it would look like this:

```bash
source ~/.dot-files/zsh/.alias
source ~/.dot-files/zsh/.prompt
source ~/.dot-files/zsh/.zsh-git-info
```
